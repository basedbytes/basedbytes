I’m a software engineer in finance.

By day: distributed systems, payments, production constraints.  
By night: systems, networking, OS internals, and things closer to the metal than my job strictly requires.

2026 goal: go *significantly* lower-level.  
Compilers, operating systems, performance, hardware-aware software.  
Aiming to get cracked, stat.

### 🔧 currently interested in
- operating systems & kernels
- networking internals
- low-level performance work
- things that break when abstractions leak

---

### 🧪 side projects
- **spoofy** — MAC address spoofing utility that survives modern macOS  
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/spoofy

---

### 📍 notes
- I like understanding how things *actually* work
- I will over-engineer to avoid paying £5
- ifconfig is not the interface it used to be

---

low-level arc in progress.
